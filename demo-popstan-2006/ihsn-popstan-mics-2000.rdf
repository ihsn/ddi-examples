      End-Decade Multiple Indicator Survey manual
    </dc:title>
    <dc:description>
      This manual is based on A Practical Handbook for Multiple-Indicator Surveys prepared for monitoring progress toward the mid-decade goals of the World Summit for Children. It was expanded and revised to reflect all of the end-decade goals and to incorporate the experience gained in conducting some 60 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) between 1995 and 1996. It also addresses specific challenges identified in the Evaluation of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 1997, and it takes us an important step closer to measuring progress in the implementation of children’s rights.

    <dcterms:abstract>
      This manual is intended to assist UNICEF staff, in their work with national counterparts and other partners, in measuring progress for children and women at end-decade through the use of household surveys. It provides a systematic approach to carrying out a household survey to fill gaps in the data necessary for reporting on the situation of children and women at the end of the millennium, and for laying down a base from which to measure change in the next decade and beyond. The end-decade assessment derives its primary focus from the World Summit for Children (WSC), held in New York in September 1990, at which 71 Heads of State and government and 88 senior officials from countries around the world pledged themselves to a Declaration and Plan of Action for Children. That commitment has now been made by 158 Heads of State, and countries around the world have proceeded to develop their own National Programmes of Action for children. Today these National Programmes of Action encompass 9 out of every 10 children on earth.

      The production of this manual was coordinated by UNICEF’s Division of Evaluation, Policy and Planning, with input from Programme Division and the UNICEF Regional Offices. The text of the manual was drafted by a number of individuals. Dr. Patricia David deserves special recognition; she was instrumental in the development of the mid-decade manual, and was largely responsible for the initial draft of the end-decade model questionnaire, as well as drafting Chapters 2, 3 and 5 and Appendices One, Two and Three of the manual. The remaining chapters were written by Ann Blanc (Chapters 7 and 8 and Appendix Six), Gareth Jones (Chapter 1), Cindy Stanton (Appendix Two on Measuring Maternal Mortality), and Anthony G. Turner (Chapters 4 and 6 and Appendix Seven). Appendix Five was adapted from the Supervisor’s Manual developed for the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and parts of Appendix Four were taken from Annex 1 in How to Weigh and Measure Children.1 Petra Morrison and Jessica Stolzberg edited the manuscript and Kia Weinstein formatted the questionnaire. The manual also benefitted from the collaborative contributions of a number of agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), MEASURE/DHS+, UNAIDS, MEASURE/Evaluation, UNESCO Institute of Statistics, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Public Health Service (CDC) and Columbia University. We would like to acknowledge in particular the contributions of the following individuals in the development of the questionnaire: Kebebew Ashagrie (ILO), Amy Cunningham (MEASURE/Evaluation), Michael Deming (CDC), Maureen Durkin (Columbia University), Thierry Lambrechts (WHO), Denise Lievesley (UNESCO Statistical Institute), and Bernhard Schwartlander (UNAIDS). A Technical Advisory Group guided the development of the questionnaire which benefitted in particular from comments provided by Ties Boerma, Laurence Grummer Strawn, Elizabeth Holt, Elisabeth Sommerfelt, Kevin Sullivan, Martin Vaessen, and Cesar Victora. The questionnaire modules were also circulated to UNICEF regional offices and were presented in several MICS workshops, which elicited useful feedback. Graham Kalton, Vijay Verma and Steve Bennett provided critical input to Chapter 4 and Appendix Seven on Sampling. Elizabeth Holt greatly facilitated our invaluable collaboration with the Demographic and Health Surveys programme and provided very useful comments on earlier drafts of the questionnaire. We appreciate the help of Joy Riggs Perla in making possible the financial support from USAID that aided the development of both manual and questionnaire. The manual was translated into French by Mohamed Ayad and into Spanish by Luis Ochoa. Tessa Wardlaw, Gareth Jones, Edilberto Loaiza and Roeland Monasch of the Division of Evaluation, Policy and Planning, contributed through reviewing, revising, formatting, organizing, as well as covering all the small but critical elements that go into the development of a practical survey manual and questionnaire with worldwide applicability.
